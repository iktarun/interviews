# Backend NodeJS Role

# Round1 - Technical

- Shallow Copy/Deep Copy

## QUESTION 1

Consider the following

A = [1,2,3]
B = A
A = [4,5,6]

What will be output if we print B?

## QUESTION 2

Consider the following

A = [1,2,3]
B = A
A[0] = [4]

What will be output if we print B?

- prototype vs obj.**proto**
- NodeJS request flow
- How to optimize the NodeJS request response
- Cluser Mode + Web workers + ngnix + Apache + Docker
- DB design for Book Store

  1. Consider a book store. A book can have multiple authors. An author can write multiple books. Design an efficient database schema for this problem.
  2. Demonstrate how the request/response APIs would work for this problem? Explain with a pseudo code.

  3. Combine the above two solutions and demonstrate various important functions/methods necessary to design the final book store.
